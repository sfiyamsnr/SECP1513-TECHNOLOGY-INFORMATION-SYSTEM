# TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM

# Assignment 1 

First of all, I’m very grateful to have had the opportunity to attend this career talk from GetMe Hired, PPG staff, alumnis of my course and also from my seniors. They helped me to identify the skills and qualities that I need to improve in order for me to reach my long term goals. By that, I will actively enjoy workshop and competition that will be held by my faculty.

Other that that, I will upgrade my skills by taking free courses and acquire certificates from MDEC, Google and HRDF. Even though one of the Second Year student said about how hard this course was, I view them as opportunities for my self-growth. I believe that in whatever we do, we still have to face some challenges along the way.

For me, the field of ICT is very dynamic due to the technologies that are constantly emerging. That’s why we need professionals in this field to stay updated with the latest technologies. Therefore, the organizations will stay at the forefront of industry trends.

# Assignment 2



# Assignment 3

Based on Industrial talk 2, Miss Qistina shared about system development, analytics, and Credence provide a valuable perspective on the intersection of technology, data, and the skills needed in the evolving field of data engineering.

Knowing how system development and analytics are related highlights the importance of data in decision-making and highlights the necessity of effective data collection, transformation, and visualization.

The history of Credence provided by Miss Qistina serves as an example of how businesses are using digital and cloud technologies to cater to local client needs. Furthermore, the technologies and tools utilized in Credence's system development—such as Tableau, PostgreSQL, and Airflow—highlight the variety of tools utilized in the sector.  

# Assignment 4

One could investigate how information technology innovation is transforming education by means of e-learning platforms, interactive tools, or customised learning experiences. These approaches can offer valuable perspectives on the advantages that both students and educators derive from education facilitated by technology. 

I've learned from this industrial visit that one way that innovation benefits human lives is by enabling people to complete everyday tasks more quickly than they could have in the past by utilizing technology. Communication is greatly impacted by technology.  

Not to add, this visit has given us new insight into how smart city initiatives leverage IT innovations to enhance wireless infrastructure, life management, and public services, all of which can serve as examples of how technology raises the sustainability and quality of life in urban areas.

# PC Assembly

Even though I encountered a minor problem with cable management after finishing the PC assembly, everything went without a hitch. Following testing, the system failed to function. After then, we reopened the case to determine the issue. It looks that the random access memory (RAM) was not put in correctly. I learned how crucial it is to pay close attention to details from this experience. I feel proud of myself for not only building a functional PC but also for learning enlightening things about efficient assembly methods and troubleshooting.

# Design Thinking

This assignment gave me a huge opportunity to improve my leadership skills as a team leader. Design thinking phases help me to execute better and come up with more effective ways to deal with what is put in front of us. Then, it thought me to be a creative thinker. I developed a deep understanding of the flexibility of creativity and the value of user feedback through the iterative process of empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
