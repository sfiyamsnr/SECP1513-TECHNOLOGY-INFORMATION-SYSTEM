First of all, I’m very grateful to have had the opportunity to attend this career talk from GetMe Hired, PPG staff, alumnis of my course and also from my seniors. They helped me to identify the skills and qualities that I need to improve in order for me to reach my long term goals. By that, I will actively enjoy workshop and competition that will be held by my faculty.

Other that that, I will upgrade my skills by taking free courses and acquire certificates from MDEC, Google and HRDF. Even though one of the Second Year student said about how hard this course was, I view them as opportunities for my self-growth. I believe that in whatever we do, we still have to face some challenges along the way.

The industrial visit to UTMDigital proved to be an enlightening experience, providing an invaluable insight into the realm of digital innovation and technology. Engaging with experts and professionals in various fields expanded my understanding of what I need to achieve in order for me to persue my dreams.

<br/><br/>
Based on Industrial talk 2, the insights shared by Miss Qistina in Industrial Talk 2 and the importance of system development, analytics, and Credence's approach, I realize the crucial role data plays in decision-making. The synergy between system development and analytics underscores the need for effective data handling throughout the process.

Miss Qistina's discussion on Credence's history showcases the adaptability of businesses to local client needs through digital and cloud technologies. It's inspiring to see how tools like Tableau, PostgreSQL, and Airflow are integral in shaping Credence's system development, emphasizing the diverse toolkit employed in the ever-evolving field of data engineering. This insight motivates me to stay abreast of such technologies and skills to thrive in this dynamic industry.

<br/><br/>
I've learned from this industrial visit that one way that innovation benefits human lives is by enabling people to complete everyday tasks more quickly than they could have in the past by utilizing technology. Communication is greatly impacted by technology.  

Not to add, this visit has given us new insight into how smart city initiatives leverage IT innovations to enhance wireless infrastructure, life management, and public services, all of which can serve as examples of how technology raises the sustainability and quality of life in urban areas.

### PC Assembly

<br/><br/>
Even though I encountered a minor problem with cable management after finishing the PC assembly, everything went without a hitch. Following testing, the system failed to function. After then, we reopened the case to determine the issue. It looks that the random access memory (RAM) was not put in correctly. I learned how crucial it is to pay close attention to details from this experience. I feel proud of myself for not only building a functional PC but also for learning enlightening things about efficient assembly methods and troubleshooting.

### Design Thinking

<br/><br/>
This assignment gave me a huge opportunity to improve my leadership skills as a team leader. Design thinking phases help me to execute better and come up with more effective ways to deal with what is put in front of us. Then, it thought me to be a creative thinker. I developed a deep understanding of the flexibility of creativity and the value of user feedback through the iterative process of empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
